An API wrapper in Python for weeb.sh!

Weeb.sh is a private, invite only API for bot developers. In order to use this wrapper, you must have access to the API yourself. If you have access, make sure to replace all instances of "token" with your actual token, such as `Bearer <token>` or `Wolke <token>`, dependent on your token type. Bearer for BearerTokens and Wolke for WolkeTokens.

Please note that the `generate_image`, `generate_status`, `generate_waifu_insult` and `generate_license` functions are locked to certain permission nodes. If you have never asked for these, you probably do not have them.

# Installation
```
pip install weeb.py
```
# Documentation
[Normal docs](https://gist.github.com/DasWolke/f9f8eb7bb9c4faeb10d33ab5bcc95898)\
[Image gen docs](https://gist.github.com/DasWolke/3b1f884ac7779faab7e1026feed78b6c)

Note that all these functions must be awaited, and thus can only be used inside of an async function.


# Get all Types

```python
import weeb

sh_client = weeb.Client(token="token", user_agent="Weeb.py/1.0.5")
                                    # User agent is formatted as NAME/VERSION

async def async_thing():
    types = await sh_client.get_types()
    print(types)
```

# Get all Tags

```python
import weeb

sh_client = weeb.Client(token="token", user_agent="Weeb.py/1.0.5")
                                    # User agent is formatted as NAME/VERSION

async def async_thing():
    tags = await sh_client.get_tags()
    print(tags)
```

# Get Random Image

```python
import weeb

sh_client = weeb.Client(token="token", user_agent="Weeb.py/1.0.5")
                                    # User agent is formatted as NAME/VERSION

async def async_thing():
img = await sh_client.get_image(imgtype='bite', nsfw=False, filetype="gif")
    print(img[0])  # prints the image url
    print(img[1])  # prints the image ID
    print(img[2])  # prints the file type
```

# Generate an Image (Requires simple Image-Gen scope)

```python

async def async_thing():
    # requires simpleimage gen scope. can be awooo, won, or eyes (awooo allows for hair and face as parameters to colour them)
    with open('./path/to/images/file.png', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(await sh_client.generate_image(imgtype='won'))
        f.close()
        # this saves to the path you set it to, even if 'file.png' doesn't exist
```

# Generate a Discord Status Mock (Requires simple Image-Gen scope)

```python

        f.close()
        # this saves to the path you set it to, even if 'file.png' doesn't exist
```

# Generate a Waifu Insult (Requires Waifu-Image Scope)

```python
sh_client = weeb.Client(token="token", user_agent="Weeb.py/1.0.5")
                                    # User agent is formatted as NAME/VERSIONN

# Generate a License (Requires Lisence Scope)

```python
